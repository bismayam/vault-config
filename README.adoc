Run local HashiCorp Vault -  `docker compose up` command.


----
export VAULT_TOKEN="mb04281999"
export VAULT_ADDR="http://127.0.0.1:8200"
----

Now add key-value pairs in Vault.

[source,shell]
----
vault kv put secret/gs-vault-config config.username=bismaya config.password=bismayam123
vault kv put secret/gs-vault-config/cloud config.username=bismayam config.password=bismayam123

Now you have written two entries in Vault `secret/vault-config` and `secret/vault-config/cloud`.

With the Vault container running and the data loaded, you are now ready to turn your attention to the Spring application.

== Run the Application and check user/pass fetched from Vault
[source,shell]

 cd vault-config/module1
 mvn spring-boot:run
